UofT Boot Camp - Challenge 1: Refactoring HTML to Semantic HTML
Welcome to the UofT Boot Camp Challenge 1! In this challenge, we’ll be refactoring an existing HTML source code to use semantic HTML elements. Semantic HTML provides better structure and accessibility to web pages.

Objective
The main objective of this challenge is to take an existing HTML file and replace non-semantic elements (like <div> or <span>) with semantic tags (such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, etc.).

Instructions
Clone this Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the Challenge Folder: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder containing the challenge files.
Review the Existing HTML File: Open the index.html file in your preferred code editor. Take note of any non-semantic elements that need to be replaced.
Refactor the HTML: Replace non-semantic elements with appropriate semantic tags. For example:
Replace <div> elements with <section> or <article> where applicable.
Use <header> for the page header, <nav> for navigation menus, and <footer> for the footer section.
Ensure proper nesting and hierarchy.
Test Your Changes: Open the refactored HTML file in a web browser and verify that the structure remains intact and visually appealing.
Commit and Push: Once you’re satisfied with your changes, commit them to your local repository and push to GitHub.
