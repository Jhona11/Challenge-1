Marketing Agency Website Accessibility Enhancement
Welcome to the Marketing Agency Website Accessibility Enhancement project! This initiative is aimed at improving the accessibility of our marketing agency's website. By refining the codebase, we aim to elevate the site's accessibility standards, making it more search engine optimized and ensuring a superior user experience for all our visitors.

Website Features
The marketing agency website provides various features tailored to meet the needs of clients and visitors. Based on the acceptance criteria and user story, here are the key features of the website:

Semantic HTML Elements
The website utilizes semantic HTML elements to enhance the structure and accessibility of the content.
Semantic elements such as "header", "nav", "main", "section", and "footer" are used to organize the webpage's content logically.

Logical Structure
The HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, ensuring ease of navigation and understanding.
Content is structured hierarchically, with headings, paragraphs, and lists used appropriately to convey information effectively.


Accessible Alt Attributes
Image elements throughout the website have accessible alt attributes, providing meaningful descriptions for users of assistive technologies.
Alt attributes are concise yet descriptive, enhancing accessibility and usability for all visitors.

Sequential Heading Attributes
Heading attributes are organized in a sequential order, following the hierarchy of content on the webpage.
Sequential headings improve navigation and readability, making it easier for users to understand the structure of the content.


Concise Title Element
The title element of the webpage provides a concise and descriptive title that accurately represents the content of the website.
A well-crafted title enhances search engine optimization (SEO) and helps users understand the purpose of the webpage at a glance.

Additional Considerations
Efficient CSS: Improve the CSS by consolidating selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of HTML elements, and including comments for clarity.
Functional Links: Ensure that all links within the website are functioning correctly and lead to the intended destinations.
Long-Term Sustainability: Aim to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability by implementing best practices and considering future maintenance needs.
